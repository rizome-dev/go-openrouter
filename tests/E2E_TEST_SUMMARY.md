# End-to-End Testing Implementation Summary

## Overview

A comprehensive end-to-end testing suite has been implemented for the OpenRouter Go SDK, ensuring complete functional parity with the OpenRouter API.

## Test Coverage

- ✅ List models endpoint
- ✅ Basic chat completion
- ✅ System messages
- ✅ Multi-turn conversations
- ✅ Generation details retrieval
- ✅ Provider preferences
- ✅ JSON response format

### 2. Streaming Tests (`streaming_test.go`)
- ✅ Basic streaming responses
- ✅ Stream cancellation via context
- ✅ Streaming with tool calls
- ✅ Timeout handling

### 3. Tool Calling Tests (`tools_test.go`)
- ✅ Basic tool calling
- ✅ Tool calling with responses
- ✅ Multiple tool registration
- ✅ Agent-based tool execution
- ✅ Forced tool selection

### 4. Structured Output Tests (`structured_test.go`)
- ✅ Schema-based structured outputs
- ✅ Go struct to JSON schema generation
- ✅ Array outputs
- ✅ Nested object structures
- ✅ Structured output helper utilities

### 5. Multimodal Tests (`multimodal_test.go`)
- ✅ Image inputs via URL
- ✅ Base64 encoded images
- ✅ Multiple image inputs
- ✅ Structured output with images
- ✅ Tool calling with images

### 6. Advanced Features Tests (`advanced_test.go`)
- ✅ Concurrent request handling

- ✅ Circuit breaker pattern
- ✅ Batch processing
- ✅ Web search integration
- ✅ Error handling scenarios
- ✅ Provider routing

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### Using Make
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test suites
make test-e2e-core
make test-e2e-streaming
make test-e2e-tools
make test-e2e-structured
make test-e2e-multimodal
make test-e2e-advanced

# Run with coverage
make test-coverage
```

### Using Test Script
```bash
# Run all tests
./tests/run_e2e.sh

# Run specific suites
./tests/run_e2e.sh core
./tests/run_e2e.sh streaming
./tests/run_e2e.sh tools
```

### Direct Go Test
```bash
# Run all E2E tests
go test ./tests/e2e -v -timeout 10m

# Run specific test
go test ./tests/e2e -v -run TestE2ESuite/TestBasicChatCompletion
```

## CI/CD Integration

A GitHub Actions workflow has been configured:
- Runs on push to main, PRs, and daily schedule
- Core tests run on PRs to minimize costs
- Full test suite runs on main branch and scheduled runs
- Supports multiple Go versions (1.21.x, 1.22.x)
- Includes coverage reporting

## Bug Fixes Applied

1. Fixed API endpoint paths in unit tests
2. Corrected response format type constants
3. Fixed message pointer dereferencing in multimodal tests
4. Updated tool choice interface usage
5. Removed unused imports
6. Fixed JSON message content handling

## Cost Optimization

- Tests use free-tier models when possible (`meta-llama/llama-3.2-1b-instruct:free`)
- Token limits are kept minimal
- PR tests run only core functionality
- Full suite runs only on main branch commits

## Next Steps

1. Add integration tests for remaining features:
   - Message transforms
   - Predicted outputs
   - Native web search models
   - Cost tracking via generation endpoint

2. Add performance benchmarks

3. Set up monitoring for API changes

4. Add mock-based tests for expensive operations

## Test Organization

Tests are organized by feature area for easy maintenance:
- Each test file focuses on a specific capability
- Tests use a shared test suite for consistent setup
- Helper functions avoid code duplication
- Clear naming conventions for test discovery
